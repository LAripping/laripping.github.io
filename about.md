Hi! My name is Leonidas, 
<!-- like the ancient Spartan king,  -->
and I built this website to index all my [published work](/category/blog-posts.html), which is currently scattered across the distant corners the internet.

I'm a security professsional, holding industry (OSEP,OSCP) and academic (BSc) certifications. My passion lies in technical research, which has led to the discovery of several [vulnerabilities](/category/cve-advisory.html) on software from companies like Cisco, Xiaomi and Wind Hellas.

Recently, I've had the chance to present my findings at a couple of security conferences, the links for the talks you can find below:  
* Rootcon 15  &middot; [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB-u0nyttMQ)
* BSides Athens 2021 &middot; [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XufcVqaQFus)

<!-- I've lived in Greece, the UK and Cyprus, and before all that I studied in Athens and did some work as a dev for a brief period, but you can find all that on LinkedIn.  -->

My interests include reverse engineering, mobile security, heavy metal and [good movies](https://github.com/LAripping/watchlist-widget).
<!-- TODO: Link the project page here instead of the GH repo -->

If you've liked the stuff in here, spotted a mistake (noone's perfect, [not even the mighty Stig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aahUbS0Hpio)), want a full CV, or just feel like talking about music, feel free to ping me on socials! 

Happy Browsing!
