Hi! My name is Leonidas and I'm an information security professional, with a passion for technical research. 

On this website you will find all my [published work](/category/blog-posts.html), articles previously released in other corners of the internet, as well as a few posts first released here. 

Throughout my career I have discovered several [vulnerabilities](/category/cve-advisory.html) on software from companies like Cisco, Xiaomi and Wind Hellas, details of which you can also find here.
