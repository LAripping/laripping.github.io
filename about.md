Hi! My name is Leonidas and I'm an information security professional, with a passion for technical research. 

On this website you will find all my [published work](/category/blog-posts.html), articles previously released in other corners of the internet, as well as a few posts first released here. 

Throughout my career I have discovered several [vulnerabilities](/category/cve-advisory.html) on software from companies like Cisco, Xiaomi and Wind Hellas, details of which you can also find here.

Hi! My name is Leonidas, and I built this website to index all my [published work](/category/blog-posts.html), which is currently scattered across the distant corners the internet.

I'm an information security professsional, holding industry (OSEP,OSCP) and academic (BSc) certifications. My passion lies in technical research, which has led to the discovery of several [vulnerabilities](/category/cve-advisory.html) on software from companies like Cisco, Xiaomi and Wind Hellas. -->

Recently, I've had the chance to present my findings at a couple of security conferences, the links for the talks you can find below:
